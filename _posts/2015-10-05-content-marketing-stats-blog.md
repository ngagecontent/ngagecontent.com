When it comes to statistics, channel your inner geek.

With all due respect to stock market analysts, baseball scouts and political gurus, modern-day stat geekdom is now universal, transcending different industries regardless of their perceived degree of quantifiability.

Translation: Nowadays even math-deficient content marketers can crunch numbers and craft effective statistics with the best of them.

The value of numerical data cannot be overstated as it pertains to content marketing. Accurate, meaningful statistics serve to:

* Counterbalance our subjective minds
* Provide clarity in the face of clutter
* Emphasize what's really important (such as ROI)

When applied appropriately, statistics provide not only insight regarding current trends but also predictability of what may happen in the future. If you could have foreseen the rise of content marketing at the start of the new millennium, your marketing plan may have evolved differently over the last 15 years.

What follows are 25 content marketing stats that make us feel like an eager puppy dropped for the first time into the canine heaven that is a dog park. We've categorized these stats for better organization, since average Americans spend one year of their life looking for lost or misplaced items (one stat down, 25 more to go). 

Pretend you were never in danger of failing that college statistics course back in the day, and analyze what the following numbers mean from the standpoint of your content marketing plan and objectives. Go ahead and geek out.
