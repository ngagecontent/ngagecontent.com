*Men Walk On Moon. Nixon Resigns. Titanic Sinks Four Hours After Hitting Iceberg. VE Day - It's All Over. Dewey Defeats Truman*.

A handful of headline writers throughout history have had it easy. A historical event, triumphant or tragic, rocks our world on their editorial watch and the ensuing iconic headline essentially writes itself.

The rest of us, though, must master the art of writing attention-garnering headlines. And while the content medium has changed since Neil Armstrong emerged from Apollo 11 onto a cratered surface in 1969 -- newspaper mastheads have been replaced in part by blog homepages, circulation replaced by clicks -- the task of headline writing remains monumental.

Just how can [modern-day content marketers](/2015/04/01/how-to-build-and-manage-distributed-writing-team/) write blog headlines readers will be enticed to click on?

### Never Underestimate the Power of a Strong First Impression

> "On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."
>
> -- David Ogilvy - "Father of Advertising"

Imagine you're a realtor trying to sell a house. The foundation is solid and you've staged the interior brilliantly, highlighting the home's charm and emphasizing its square footage. Yet, despite all your efforts, you overlooked the front yard entirely. Curb appeal is altogether lacking and the absence of landscaping would make a fraternity house lawn look pristine. Think you'll even get one prospective buyer through the front door?

All too often, writers labor over a blog post for days...then mistakenly just plug in a headline at the end as an afterthought. By then, the writer is sick of looking at the piece and simply wants it off his or her plate.

<a class="tweet-quote">Devote ample time to writing your headline and make that first impression meaningful.</a> Consider adopting the 50/50 rule, whereby half your time is spent constructing an effective headline and lede, and the remainder is spent rounding out your blog.

### Pretend Print Space Limitations Still Exist

> "Be sincere; be brief; be seated."
>
> -- President Franklin D. Roosevelt

Back in our journalistic heyday, space dictated headlines. A copy editor was limited to the available space, regardless of what the ideal headline might be. The city of Cleveland was named for expedition leader Moses Cleaveland, but the first "a" was dropped from the name after an early newspaper was plagued by space constraints.

But even in today's [infinite digital universe](/2015/03/17/why-you-should-embrace-agile-content/), punchy, concise blog headlines work best, attracting more attention as well as proving more Tweetable and SEO-friendly. Get to the point quickly or your readership won't wait around to learn your (probably insightful) point. A good rule-of-thumb is to keep your headline 10 words or less (yes, this hypocritical post has an 11-word headline).

### Intrigue Your Audience

> "It's the unknown that draws people."
>
> -- Author E.A. Bucchianeri

Ultimately, whether short-and-sweet or long-winded, your blog headline must pique your readers' interest. Curiosity may kill a cat, but it results in numerous click-throughs for a successful content marketer.

Readership fascination can be achieved through various strategies:
* Make actionable statements: "How to Form Lifelong Friendships as a Child"
* Be unique: You + Him/Her + Coffee - Agendas = Perfect First Date"
* Use "listicles" (articles presented in the form of a list): "7 Ways to Confirm You're a Product of the '80s"
* Sound authoritative: "The Best Untapped Entrepreneurial Ideas You'll Ever Find"

### Keywords = Clicks

> "Good SEO work only gets better over time..."
>
> -- Search engine optimization consultant [Jill Whalen](https://twitter.com/jillwhalen)

For many [content platforms](https://beegit.com), your blog post's headline doubles as the title for that particular web page. Consequently, you should incorporate suitable keywords regarding your topic or business into your headline to maximize the benefits of search engine optimization. Ideally, include keywords near the start of your headline.

So what types of keywords enhance clickability? Use positive keywords that engage your readers and offer a reward for reading. Examples include "How to Save for Retirement without Sacrificing Travel Bliss" and "New Best Friend: 5 Tips for Selecting Your Canine Companion."

Keep in mind that effective keyword headlines answer questions for your audience. They will be searching online for how to do something or why they need something. Your headline should answer that question with the right keywords -- and then your content must support the headline's claim.


### Accuracy Still Matters

> "It takes a lot of effort to win back credibility after having lost it so heavily."
>
> -- Italian politician Giorgio Napolitano

Go back and read the last headline contained within the first paragraph: *Dewey Defeats Truman*. Remember this infamous headline, published on the front page of the Chicago Daily Tribune in November of 1948? The combination of an early press deadline and a surprising election outcome resulted in a legendary mistake for the newspaper, which President Harry Truman immortalized in a [memorable photograph](http://deweydefeatstruman.com/).

[A misleading or inaccurate headline equals the demise of your readership](/2015/09/04/why-proofreading-is-important-for-blog-posts/), as ever-finicky blog readers disappointed in what they clicked on are unlikely to return. However powerful or effective, your headline need to reflect the body of your work appropriately. Otherwise, it's the equivalent of spam.

The next time you embark on a blog-inspired content mission, start from the beginning and craft a powerful headline.  You just might be pleasantly surprised with the results. One small step for your blog, one giant leap in click-worthy content.
